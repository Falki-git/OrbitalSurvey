 * 
 * TODO:
 * - change EVE visual texture to the mesh variant
 * - add EC usage
 * - Map scene overlay
 * 
 * 
 * TODO LONG-TERM:
 * - make Settings adjustable in mod settings
 * - adjust FOV for large bodies
 * - larger FOV for larger commstrength 
 * - live position indicators and next/previous orbit
 * - scanning triangle in Map scene when active
 * - altimeter data?
 * - scanning parts
 * - buffering and transmitting scans
 * - buffer scans until transmitted
 * - see if clouds can be removed
 * - maybe a settings that continuously keeps the body pixelated/blank/blurry until it's scanned 
 *
 * TODO SCIENCE:
 * - transmit to get science
 * - scanning mode progression
 * - larger FOV progression
 *
 * DONE:
 * - save/load persistence of mapping data (POC done)
 * - mark 95% as complete
 * - analytic gathering of data while timewarping - retroactive mapping for higher warp factors
 * - minimum and maximum altitude for mapping
 * - add ideal altitude. Above that viewing cone shrinks. Define max altitude as well (keep in my body's SOI)
 * - finish scanning module on antennas: add additional info (mix/max altitude, fixed FOV, map percentage, draw overlay?, open map?...)
 * - UITK UI 
 * - handle scene changes (remove overlay, maybe close window?)
 * - change to fixed FOV, keep adjustable for debugging
 * - PAM button for opening GUI
 * - add OAB part descriptions
 * - open exact map from PAM
 * - fix UI dropdowns occupying large space than they should
